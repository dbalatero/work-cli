# work-cli

Awesome command line tools for managing the lifecycle of Github pull requests.

* Branch and open a beautiful draft PR by typing `work begin` from `main/master`
* Fast switch between your open PRs with `work pr switch`
* Open or focus your PR in the browser with `work pr show`
* Ask for a review on Github with `work review alice`

Currently only works on macOS, but could be tweaked for Linux/Windows!

## Installation

‚è∞ I'm busy, can I paste in 1 line of shell code?

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dbalatero/work-cli/main/bin/install)
```

ü§ì I'm paranoid about running code directly from curl:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dbalatero/work-cli.git ~/.work-cli

cd ~/.work-cli
bin/install       # don't forget to audit the script, you nerd
```

### Additional setup/dependencies

* `work` will always automatically install any dependencies it needs for you.
* Occasionally you'll need to generate an API key (Github) - `work` will magically prompt you when it's time to do so.

My philosophy is that READMEs are bad, only 20% of people read them, and it's better if software just does everything for you, at the exact moment you need it.

## FAQ

### I forget how to quit Vim, can I use VSCode to edit my PR descriptions?

Sure, why not. Just add this to your `bashrc/zshrc/whatever` file and reload
your shell:

```bash
export EDITOR="code --wait"
```

<!-- edit -->
